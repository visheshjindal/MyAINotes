# PlatformHub Adoption Discovery Steps

- Requesting repo access: To access the app's source code and make changes, we need to request permission from the app team to access their repository. This can be done by sending an email or a message to the app team lead or the owner of the repository.
- Checking prerequisites for app development: To develop the app, we need to make sure that we have the required tools and frameworks installed on our machine. For example, if the app is written in Kotlin, we need to have Kotlin installed and configured. We also need to check the minimum SDK version that the app supports and ensure that we have the corresponding Android SDK installed.
- Checking prerequisites for capabilities: To add any capabilities to the app, such as Analytics, we need to check if there are any prerequisites that we need to fulfill. For example, if we want to use AppDynamics for Analytics, we need to have AppDynamics SDK installed and configured on our machine and on the app.
- Reviewing existing code and capabilities: To avoid duplicating or conflicting with any existing code or capabilities that the app already has, we need to review the app's code and see what features or journeys it has implemented using EDB. EDB is a platform that provides various capabilities for app development, such as Networking or Analytics. We need to understand how the app is using EDB and how we can leverage it for our integration.
- Finding out flavors: To integrate PlatformHub into the app, we need to find out what flavors the app is using. Flavors are different variants of the app that have different configurations or features. For example, some flavors might use EDB Mauth for authentication, while others might use Entities/Markets for localization. We need to know what flavors the app has and how they affect our integration.
- Analyzing Application/AppDelegate class: To integrate PlatformHub into the app, we need to modify the Application/AppDelegate class of the app. This is the class that initializes and manages the app's lifecycle. We need to analyze this class and see how we can add PlatformHub initialization and configuration code into it. We also need to consider the performance impact and initialization flow of PlatformHub and make sure that it does not affect the app's performance or functionality.
- Designing integration and release strategy: To integrate PlatformHub into the app, we need to design a strategy that outlines how we will make changes to the app's code, test them, and release them. We also need to decide whether we can develop directly against dev or need a separate branch for our integration. Dev is the development environment where we can test our changes before releasing them. A branch is a copy of the code that we can modify without affecting the original code. We need to choose a strategy that suits our needs and follows the best practices of app development.
- Creating demonstration feature: To demonstrate PlatformHub's functionality, we need to create something that can show how PlatformHub works and what benefits it provides. For example, we can create a AppDynamics message that shows some analytics data from PlatformHub or a dummy plugin that simulates some PlatformHub capability. We need to create something that is simple but effective and can showcase PlatformHub's value proposition.
- Being aware of release process and calendar: To release our integration, we need to be aware of the app's release process and calendar. The release process is the steps that we need to follow to release our changes to the production environment where users can access them. The release calendar is the schedule that shows when the app releases new versions or updates. We need to coordinate with the app team and follow their release process and calendar to ensure that our integration is released smoothly and without any issues.
